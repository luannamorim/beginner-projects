# Initial Python Study Projects

Welcome to my initial Python study projects! This repository contains a collection of small projects I've developed while learning and practicing fundamental concepts of the Python language.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of these projects is to apply the knowledge gained during my Python learning journey. Each folder represents a specific project, with its own set of challenges and solutions. I am committed to expanding my understanding of the language by exploring different domains and applying good programming practices.
